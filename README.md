# Sum-It-Up Frontend
This is the frontend code for my other project Sum-It-Up which is a project for giving a brief information about a video by summarizing the transcript of it.
Kindly refer to that repository for more information.

## How to run?
Clone the repo in the directory of your choice. Then run the following command.
```bash
npm install
```

Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser and voila! you've started the project.
